                <h2>River Rafting Hells Canyon </h3>
                    <h3>Highlights</h3>

                    <p>Hells Canyon Rafting on the Snake River in Idaho straddles the borders of Idaho and Oregon and is
                        the deepest river gorge in North America. According to Nez Perce tribal legend the mythical
                        figure
                        "coyote" dug Hells Canyon with a big stick to protect the tribe's ancestors in the Blue
                        Mountains of
                        Oregon from the "Seven Devils" across the gorge in Idaho.</p>

                    <h3>What is this trip about?</h3>

                    <p>Snake River Through Hells Canyon Rafting one of America's greatest rivers has played host to ROW
                        Adventures' guest for over 25 years. If you
                        have not experience the great Snake River, it's big rapids, incredible hikes and history, the
                        country's deepest river canyon with the world's greatest guides...you should not wait any
                        longer!
                    </p>

                    <p>We know you have a lot of options when choosing a Snake River outfitter and we are happy you are
                        considering us. Hells Canyon straddles the borders of Idaho and Oregon and is the deepest river
                        gorge in North America. According to Nez Perce tribal legend, the mythical figure "coyote" dug
                        Hells
                        Canyon with a big stick to protect the tribe's ancestors in the Blue Mountains of Oregon from
                        the
                        "Seven Devils" across the gorge in Idaho.</p>

                    <p>Our Snake River rafting adventures in Idaho are journeys through a land rich in myth and geologic
                        wonder. Running south to north, this beauty in Hells Canyon cuts through some of the most
                        rugged,
                        spectacular landscape on earth. Boulders and rock slides have rolled into the river to create
                        the
                        biggest white water rafting rapids in the Pacific Northwest. High-crested waves and
                        paddle-swallowing holes drench us in white water excitement.</p>

                        greatest rivers and an unbelievable voyage through time, where layered rock strata and shifting
                        landscapes give way to riverside hot springs, pit dwellings once inhabited by the Shoshone
                        people,
                        and old Gold Rush homesteads that still leave their imprints today.
